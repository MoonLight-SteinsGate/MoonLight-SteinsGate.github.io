I am currently an Assistant Researcher at the [Academy of Military Science](https://zh.wikipedia.org/wiki/中国人民解放军军事科学院). I have received my Bachelor's degree from the Department of Mathematics, Nanjing University at June 2017, and my Master's and Ph.D. degree from the College of Computer, National University of Defense Technology at December 2019 and June 2024, supervised by Prof. Yong Tang and Prof. Kai Lu, respectively. My research interests mainly focus on the areas of system security, including hardware-assisted software security, greybox fuzzing, trusted execution environment, control-flow integrity, and debloating. Recently, I have also been trying my hand at research in the field of optimizing the inference of large language model.

From July 2021 to December 2022, I was a visiting student at the [COMPASS Lab](https://compass.sustech.edu.cn/index_en.html), Southern University of Science and Technology (SUSTech), supervised by Prof. [Fengwei Zhang](https://fengweiz.github.io/).

Now I am looking for students and engineers who are interested in system security and system for AI. If you are intrigued by the prospect of academic collaboration in these fields, please feel free to email me at [yuetai17@nudt.edu.cn](mailto:yuetai17@nudt.edu.cn).
